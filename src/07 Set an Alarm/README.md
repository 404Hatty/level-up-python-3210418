# Python Code Challenges: Set an Alarm

Your goal is to implement a function, `set_alarm()`, that takes three inputs arguments for the time to set an alarm to go off, the sound file you want to play, and the message to display when the alarm time is reached. 


## Example Test Output
```console
$ set_alarm(time.time()+1, 'alarm.wav', 'Wake up!')
Alarm set for Thu Dec 12 13:27:07 2019
Wake up!
```
